# Jetpack Compose Project - Wordle

## The clone of the popular game Wordle by the New York Times

The project is a game where the user guesses a 5-letter word by using the in-built keyboard. After every guess, the game evaluates the guess. If a letter is gray it is wrong, if it is yellow it is right but in the wrong position within the word, and if it is green it is a successful guess.
