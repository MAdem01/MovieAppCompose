# Jetpack Compose Project - Wordle

## The clone of the popular game wordle by the New York Times 

The project is a game where the user guesses a 5 letter word by using the in-built keyboard. After every guess the game evaluates the guess. If a letter is gray it is wrong, if it is yellow it is right but in the wrong position within the word and if it green it is a succesfull guess.
